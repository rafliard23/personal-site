So, where I have been lately in the past a year? I have been busy with life and projects, thankfully landed on a nice prosprect that I enjoyed so far and supportive environment. There are a lot things to say but glad I made it right here and able to rebuild this site, felt like neglected and hopefully 2026 I can fill my site with contents and writing.

## Where I have been?

2025 was a long year for me, landed an opportunity in late December 2024 and started to work by January 2025. It was fun as I managed to work on something I enjoy and aspire to. Had several projects in 2025 which is fun while also one that still on-going due to nature of development. Hired as Embedded Software Dev and then assigned as Embedded Hardware Dev at current project, wouldn't want to argue with that as I also have knowledge in electronics/hardware side so why not to take everything for granted (and for personal development of course!).

Embedded System definitely interesting but we have to be grounded in term of what I could take because of course each person have their own limit of what they could learn. I thoroughly enjoy software and hardware side as both complement in harmony to develop optimal device that could deliver efficient performance and usability while not breaking bank for cost.

## Embedded System and Arduino

Late this year, we heard the news that Qualcomm acquire Arduino which leads to everyone scrutinize the term and policy that taken place put on by Qualcomm. As someone who used Arduino back when I delve in ATMega it's kinda sad to see how things go but as nowaday we have a lot alternative platform to learn, for example Espressif ESP32 and STElectronics STM32 lineups which are still decent enough for hobbyist while also some are used in industrial application (so people could also learn what is in the industry application with similar hardware). However the most predictable loss would be entry level and academic one that relies on basic Arduino _programming_/HAL or its IDE but as of December 2025 we haven't heard any news of this Qualcomm & Arduino situation.

## Hardware and Software

In my opinion both are equally interesting and complement each other. In this year I can say have 50:50 as developing in hardware/electronics and software. I found RTOS interesting and necessary to move forward and Zephyr is nice framework while have its own issues (to setup everything), If I want to learn further regarding RTOS I will use Zephyr, use ESP32 as hardware material as you can get them cheap and if you prefer learn networking too, otherwise STM32 is good alternative.

Hardware side, I'm more of assisting PCB layout for electrical work, learn new software called Pulsonix while it has its own workflow, the fundamental concept of PCB layout remain same as if I use KiCAD or EAGLE. Using other software forces me to learn and adapt each software advantages and shortcomings. Personally I prefer KiCAD but some features of Pulsonix is nice for drawing schematics and layout, to each for their own.

Where both world meet? when you have to interface hardware and software, I met several moments that makes me approach a design by both hardware and software side and then try to resolve the problem by consider both side implementation pros and cons. I want to make the programmer have several solution to implement a function while making the design as simple as posisble to reduce the complexity and cost.

## This Blog Site

As cliche as it can get, I want to write content in this site. Hopefully I can pour one some thought or two and also share my project whenever I could. Hopefully 2026 could be the year I enjoy most so far :D
