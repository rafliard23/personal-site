Hello there, you can address me as Rafli. I am Embedded System Developer. This site provides as my personal space and notes to document my idea, passion, opinion as well my personal interests.

While I mostly delve in Engineering and Practical Solution nowaday, formerly I used to do a lot game modding and gaming. As graduated Mechatronics Engineer, I have multiple interests including Electronics, Embedded system, fair share of Mechanical Design, Automotive, Motorsport, Personal Computers, and Learning.
